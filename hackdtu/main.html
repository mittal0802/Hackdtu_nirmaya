      <button type="button" class="collapsible">
        <p class="question">Q.</p> Which COVID-19 vaccines are licensed in India?
      </button>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Two vaccines that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control
          Organization (CDSCO) in India are Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India)
          and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).</p>

          over the other. Both would work fine in preventing the infection as well as prevent a person from going into
          severe state of the disease. As a long-term effect, it would be preventing death for elderly people or those
